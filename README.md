# Healthcare Predictive Analytics (Disease Detection)

##  Project Description

This project predicts the risk of diseases like **diabetes** using machine learning. Medical data is preprocessed, normalized, and classified to identify whether a patient is likely to have the disease.

---
## Goal: 
Predict risk of diseases like diabetes or heart conditions.

---
## Guidelines:

Use UCI or Kaggle datasets.

Normalize medical records for consistency.

Apply classification models with feature importance analysis.

Highlight ethical data handling and patient privacy.

---
## Objectives

* Analyze healthcare dataset
* Normalize medical records
* Build a classification model
* Identify important health features
* Ensure ethical data handling and privacy

---

##  Tools & Technologies

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab, GitHub

---

##  Dataset
